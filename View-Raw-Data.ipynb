Cleve Jones at 626-5 725.  pgNbr=1 NAMES: A National AIDS Memorial  On Sunday, Octoaer 11, 1987 thousands of Americans will gather at the U.S. Capitol to demand that  the President and Congress take immediate action to substantially increase Federal funding of AIDS  research, treatment, education and service.  The NAMES Project is a nation-wide campaign to memorialize the tens of thousands of Americans who  have already been killed by the AIDS epidemic.  We are creating a memorial composed of thousands of individual fabric panels, each bearing the name of  a single person lost to AIDS. Designed and completed in homes across America by the friends, lovers, and  families of people killed by AIDS, the panels will be assembled into one massive expanse of names and  displayed across the Capitol Mall in Washington, D.C. on Sunday, October 11, 1987.  Inspired by the American folk art traditions of quilting and sewing bees, the NAMES project is a positive  expression of personal loss as well as a dramatic illustration of the impact of AIDS on American society.  Some people will choose to create their panel privately as a personal memorial to someone they loved. We  hope, however, that many more will follow the traditions of quilting and sewing bees, involving friends,  families and co-workers in designing and creating the panels.  Businesses and organizations such as sports teams, political and social clubs, churches, and professional  associations are urged to sponsor panels for members who have died.  HOW TO CREATE A MEMORIAL PANEL:  1. Select a durable and light-weight fabric of any color for the background.  Cut and hem the fabric to 3\\' x 6\\'. (We\\'ll hem it for you if you leave 3\" extra fabric on each side.)  2. Design the letters. Some suggestions:  Applique: sew letter to background fabric  Painting: brush letters on with paint, dye, or ink  Stencil: spray paint cut-out letters  Collage: glue on material with fabric glue  Embroider: sew on beads, sequins or rhinestones  When the panel is complete, take time to write a one or two page description of the person you have memorialized.  Tell us what this person meant to you and how you think he or she should be remembered.  Enclose a photograph of the person if you have one and are willing to part with it-we cannot be responsible for re\\xad turning photographs or other mementos.  4. Wrap the panel securely before mailing it to the NAMES Project.  P.O. Box 14573  San Francisco, CA 94114  5. Please include as generous a contribution as possible to help us meet our transportation and material costs. All con\\xad tributions are tax-deductible.  6. Have any questions?  Call us at 415/626-5725  Deadline: All panels must be received by September 15, 1987.  Please note: All materials submitted to The NAMES Project become the property of The Project and cannot be returned or reclaimed  Volunteer, call Mike Smith at 863-0767 or  by sender.
