pentamidine isethionate in 6 ml of distilled water
was inhaled for 35 to 40 minutes. In patients with
diffuse alveolar infiltrates, significantly higher
concentrations of aerosolized pentamidine reached the
airspaces than did the I.V. form of the drug; BAL
pentamidine concentrations in sediment were 9.34
31
1.74 ng/ml post-I.V. administration vs 705 ± 242
ng/ml post-aerosol (mean ± SEM, P < 0.05).³
Serum pentamidine levels were low or undetectable
after aerosolization. The large variation in BAL levels
following aerosol but not I.V. administration suggests
that the variability is due to aerosol deposition and
not to BAL technique.
31
32
Conte and colleagues, using another aerosol device
(the Ultra Vent nebulizer), have conducted a similar
study and reached similar conclusions. The
efficiency of the two nebulizers in the studies could
not be directly compared due to different methods
of BAL analysis.
33
Three pilot studies of aerosolized pentamidine as
treatment have been conducted. In one study,³
Montgomery and colleagues used 600 mg of
pentamidine in the Respirgard II nebulizer in order
to at least match the dose used in the pharmacokinetic
study cited earlier³¹ and to shorten the duration of
therapy. Montgomery et al had noted that aerosol
administration for longer than 30 minutes was not
well tolerated and that the nebulizer became
progressively less efficient. They estimated the
deposited dose to be between 30 and 60 mg because
the nebulizer probably delivers about 5 to 10% of
the dose to the lungs."" In this study, 15 AIDS patients
with initial episodes of mild to moderate PCP received
a 25-minute daily inhalation of aerosol pentamidine
for 21 days. Thirteen of the 15 patients responded
to therapy. In successfully treated patients, mean PaO2
was 67.9 torr before therapy and 80.1 torr after
therapy; mean vital capacity was 50.8% of predicted
value before therapy and 67.9% of predicted value
after therapy. No adverse systemic reactions (such
as renal, liver, and hematologic abnormalities,
hypoglycemia, or hypotension) were observed during
therapy. Serum pentamidine concentrations were less
than 10 ng/ml in 12 of 14 patients. In two patients,
serum pentamidine concentrations were 22 and 32
ng/ml at the end of therapy. Coughing was noted
in 12 patients and was successfully treated in 9 patients
by administration of an aerosolized bronchodilator
prior to aerosolization of pentamidine or by lowering
680
the gas flowrate to the pentamidine aerosol delivery
device. 33 Three patients who had persistent cough
had a history of bronchospasm or smoking. After
one year of follow-up, only two relapses have
occurred.
32
In a second study, Conte and colleagues studied
inhaled or reduced-dose pentamidine for treatment
of PCP.32 Nine of the 13 patients inhaling aerosolized
pentamidine for treatment of mild PCP had a
satisfactory response in this study; three patients could
not be evaluated due to early withdrawal, and one
had treatment failure. Two of the nine patients who
could be evaluated had neutropenia, but these patients
had been receiving zidovudine (azidothymidine,
AZT) and had low pretreatment leukocyte counts.
Other mild adverse reactions involved cough,
bronchospasm, rash in one patient, and temperature
elevations. The nebulizer (Ultra Vent) dose was 4
mg/kg body weight; this was nebulized over a 30-
to 60-minute period."" Serum pentamidine concen-
trations were greater than 20 ng/ml in 5 of 13 patients.
The higher serum pentamidine concentrations in this
study as compared to that of Montgomery and
colleagues are unexplained but may be due to the
increased airway deposition, resulting in systemic
absorption. Three of the successfully treated patients
experienced early relapse. Based on dose, duration
of treatment, particle size, deposition estimates, higher
nebulizer flowrate, and lack of a nebulizer reservoir,
the total dose delivered to the alveoli in this study
was probably one half to one fourth the dose used
by Montgomery and colleagues; whether this explains
the difference in patient outcome in the two studies
is not known.
The third study was by Godfrey-Faussett and
colleagues. An acorn nebulizer (System 22) that
lacks a drug reservoir was used with or without a
bead filter at two different doses in 13 patients (4
mg/kg in the first 6 patients and 8 mg/kg in the
other 7 patients). Only two patients responded; the
others were removed for failure to respond or cough.
The MMAD of aerosol from their nebulizer system
was 1.3 for the first 10 patients and 0.8 for
the remainder. They concluded that the optimum
characteristics of the best delivery system need to
be determined prior to recommendation that
aerosolized pentamidine be used for treatment.
Other side effects of aerosolized pentamidine
therapy include hypoglycemia, reported in one patient

As per last month's plan, the membership in attendance spent an
hour further discussing several items related to the new Board and
its structure as well as the overall agency structure (see last
month's minutes for a copy of the structure as outlined in the by-
laws).
Discussion began with a report of a meeting between local Board
members and Venus Medina, a Washington-based staff person with
National AIDS Network. She supervises projects in L.A., Boston
and Phoenix and has access to RFP's nationwide. She offers the
Board her fundraising skills, proposal writing skills and national
information. She seems very energetic and committed to helping
WAN in any way she can.
Next the group moved to a discussion of the relationship between
the general membership and the Board. There were mixed opinions
about what the membership intended for the Board. Some saw the
Board as a practical body the carry out, on a daily basis, the
operations of WAN while others felt the Board was merely a
necessary legal entity. There was general concern that the power
stay with the membership and that the Board work for the main
body. Several items were seen as crucial to structuring the Board
in a way that works. These include: that the Board is made up of
members we trust to carry out the interests of the larger body,
and that they can be removed if they do not; that the Board
memebrs are people who have agreed to give a larger segment of
their time to WAN; that WAN already has a statement of mission,
priorities and goals which the Board will follow. Members felt
strongly that Board meetings should be open and that members
should be informed of the agenda in advance. After much
discussion, there was general agreement that the Board would carry
out the work of the body, that they would spend more time looking
into issues and bringing recommendations to the main body, that
they might be thought of as a ""central committee"" (a smaller group
comprised of members) and that they would eventually be
responsible for overseeing personnel issues. Many members also
felt it was important that, although the Board is directly
accountable to the membership, it also needs to have some defined
autonomy and power. A slightly altered Board and membership
structure was proposed (see attached) which was generally
approved. At this point in the discussion, it was proposed and
accepted that the Board members meet and discuss their function,
then come back to the body with their thoughts.
The membership also wanted the Board to prioritize a few items for
discussions along with structure. These included electing
officers and adding an HIV+ member in one of the 6 auxiliary

With all the news and activity lately about the FDA, and assuming
that they will soon visit us and that they may do/say/ask for something, I
would like to see the board discuss possible approaches to dealing with
them. Lewin says that the local San Diego FDA rep asked Tom Hansen
about his contacts for pharmacetuicals from Mexico. They may ask us the
same and I think we should discuss how we would like to respond to them
about it. I also think that we should be in touch with other clubs about it
and share our conversations with each other. Ken Reiche of the Boulder
Buyer's Club suggested a conference call among the buyer's clubs.
Notes for Board Mtg of 10/16/91
FDA
My personal opinion is that we should have a friendly and open
attitude, but tell them very little, and refuse to be regulated. That last
may require lot of networking and support-building to be successful.
Our mission is to get therapies to people, not to follow government
guidelines.
See the attached sheet for suggestions from Curtis Ponzi.
The AIDS Project East Bay wants someone to talk for 1/2 hour about
alternative therapies / Buyer's Clubs at a training for their volunteers on
a Saturday in November in Oakland. If anyone is interested, call Nisa at
834-8181. If not, we can send her information to hand out. She needs to
know by Monday, 10/21.

Teri Moore reported on the recent DPH conference. She was alarmed
by the statistics regarding women and children. (These are
available on cassette and slides with Pat Evans) The content of
the conference she found disappointing in that San Francisco is
the model for many programs currently beginning to be applied to
smaller communities. Therefore, the conference held little new
information for SF based workers. There were lots more workshops
related to women this year. Children, however, are still a
largely ignored population.
Montreal/ San Francisco AIDS Conferences
WAN has heard that the planners of the 1990 International AIDS
Conference in San Francisco are planning very little or no
community involvement and that the one presentation geared towards
the general community is currently planned for the morning of the
SF Gay Freedom Day Parade. Many members in attendance expressed
outrage at this if, in fact, it is true. The group felt that we
must begin now to make our voices heard to assure community
involvement and social services information be included in the
conference. Montreal has responded to community concerns and
seems to be planning a broadbased and inclusive conference. It
makes no sense that San Francisco, the hub of AIDS acitivity, do
less.
A few suggestions were offered to begin dealing with this issue.
First, John Ziegler and Paul Volberding (two of the main
conference planners) will be invited to a WAN meeting to discuss
our concerns and find out what they have planned. Second, a
committee will be formed not only to plan this meeting but to make
our voice heard in relation to the conference. We will pass on
further information as we receive it.
Legislative Updates (102/96)
Many people in the know still believe 102 will pass in the
November election. This would be disastrous for the HIV affected
community. A group working to defeat both bills meets every
Wednesday at 7:30, 25 Van Ness Ave. in SF. Please try to attend
the fundraisers and get involved to defeat these very frightening
bills! Although the focus has been largely on 102, it is very
important to continue to talk about 96, which more specifically
affects people of color and those accused of crimes.
In another development in the legislature, the Waxman Bill,
including as one of its provisions mandatory testing of
prostitutes, has now passed both the Senate and the House.

was administered bi-weekly; in the next set of trials,
patients were randomized to 30, 45, or 60 mg weekly
for the first month and then bi-weekly. The 30-

prophylaxis breakthrough. They reported that a total
of 120 patients with AIDS and PCP had been treated

episodes in patients receiving 45 mg, and one episode
in patients receiving 60 mg. It is unclear how much

doing dose-ranging studies with a Fisoneb ultrasonic
nebulizer.
The optimal dose, particle size, and frequency of
administration for prophylactic aerosol pentamidine
are not known. A change in the distribution, severity
of occurrence, and frequency is apparent even at low
doses delivered to the alveoli, but whether higher
doses prove more efficacious without significant side
effects is yet to be determined. It will be difficult
to compare specific doses with those achieved at other
centers using different nebulizers because the amount
of pentamidine deposited in the alveoli is so dependent
upon equipment and patient factors. Furthermore,
uncontrolled studies may involve patients with
different rates of relapse because the incidence of
recurrent PCP is dependent on time between episodes
of PCP and the start of prophylaxis. 52
Administration
Lypholized pentamidine must be reconstituted with
sterile water, because saline solutions cause the
pentamidine to precipitate out of solution. We have
chosen the volume of the diluent to be 6 ml because
100 mg/ml is the saturation concentration, and also
to standardize therapy. After reconstitution, pentam-
idine is stable at 20°C for 24 hours, at 4°C for 104
hours, and at -10°C for 5 months (Abu Alam PhD,
LyphoMed Inc: unpublished data).
We cannot comment on other nebulizer systems
used to deliver aerosolized pentamidine because we
have personal experience with only the Respirgard
II Nebulizer System. However, if one uses the
Respirgard II Nebulizer System, the nebulizer flowrate
should be 5-7 L/min using a pressure-compensated
flowmeter attached to a 50-psi dry-gas source; this
generates a nebulizer-line pressure of 20 to 25 psi.
If the 50-psi dry-gas source is not available for
prophylactic administration of non-acutely ill patients,
we recommend the BUNN BA 400 air compressor or
equivalent with a variable pressure (20-50 psi)
regulating knob. The Respirgard II Nebulizer System
should be attached to a PALL BRO-1 nebulizer-line
bacterial filter or equivalent, which is attached to
a nipple adapter on the oxygen DISS connector of
the air compressor. The variable-psi knob must be
adjusted between 23 and 25 psi to match the pressure",0.9117760062217712,"aerosolized pentamidine for p. carinii

administration
lypholized pentamidine must be reconstituted with
sterile water, because saline solutions cause the
pentamidine to precipitate out of solution. we have
chosen the volume of the diluent to be 6 ml because
100 mg/ml is the saturation concentration, and also
to standardize therapy. after reconstitution, pentam-
idine is stable at 20°c for 24 hours, at 4°c for 104
hours, and at -10°c for 5 months (abu alam phd,
lyphomed inc: unpublished data).
we cannot comment on other nebulizer systems
used to deliver aerosolized pentamidine because we
have personal experience with only the respirgard
ii nebulizer system. however, if one uses the
respirgard ii nebulizer system, the nebulizer flowrate
should be 5-7 l/min using a pressure-compensated
flowmeter attached to a 50-psi dry-gas source; this
generates a nebulizer-line pressure of 20 to 25 psi.
if the 50-psi dry-gas source is not available for
prophylactic administration of non-acutely ill patients,
we recommend the bunn ba 400 air compressor or
equivalent with a variable pressure (20-50 psi)
regulating knob. the respirgard ii nebulizer system
should be attached to a pall bro-1 nebulizer-line
bacterial filter or equivalent, which is attached to
a nipple adapter on the oxygen diss connector of
the air compressor. the variable-psi knob must be

group has been 37, compared to 6 in the 152 patients

be determined.

in another san francisco study, fallat and
colleagues have treated 211 patients with a dose
of 30 mg of aerosolized pentamidine delivered by
the fan jet nebulizer."" these investigators have
estimated that relapse was delayed an average of 5
months in their patients."" lowery and colleagues
have reviewed the radiographic pattern of relapse
patients on aerosol pentamidine and found a striking
increase of relapses in the upper lobes. this
correlates with the predicted deposition of most of
the drug in the lower lobes and suggests that patients
respond to the aerosol. in order to achieve more even
distribution of the aerosol throughout all lung zones,
it may be efficacious to have the patient breathe at
a est rate, breathe higher doses, and/or periodically
breathe from residual volume during the aerosol
administration.""
50
other data on aerosol prophylaxis have been
reported by bernard and colleagues from sloan
kettering medical center."" aerosolized pentamidine
has been administered using a siemens ""green
machine""* hand-held ultrasonic nebulizer in this
protocol. in the first trials, 30 mg of pentamidine
was administered bi-weekly; in the next set of trials,
patients were randomized to 30, 45, or 60 mg weekly
for the first month and then bi-weekly. the 30-
and 45-mg doses were discontinued because of
prophylaxis breakthrough. they reported that a total
of 120 patients with aids and pcp had been treated
for an average of 5 months. five episodes of pcp
have been reported in patients receiving 30 mg, two
episodes in patients receiving 45 mg, and one episode
in patients receiving 60 mg. it is unclear how much
of the pentamidine actually reached the lung periphery
of these patients since the ""green machine"" ultrasonic
nebulizer used in this study produces a median particle
size 12 (table 1). because of this large particle

""green machine"" is a nickname bestowed on the device by

oropharynx. bernard and colleagues are now
doing dose-ranging studies with a fisoneb ultrasonic
nebulizer.
the optimal dose, particle size, and frequency of
administration for prophylactic aerosol pentamidine
are not known. a change in the distribution, severity
of occurrence, and frequency is apparent even at low
doses delivered to the alveoli, but whether higher
doses prove more efficacious without significant side
effects is yet to be determined. it will be difficult
to compare specific doses with those achieved at other
centers using different nebulizers because the amount
of pentamidine deposited in the alveoli is so dependent
upon equipment and patient factors. furthermore,

Dear Gentlepersons:
We have not yet met. My name is Tomas Fabregas and I have AIDS.
Almost two years ago I was diagnosed with AIDS during my second semester at
Berkeley's Graduate School of Business. The diagnosis was quite a surprise. It
certainly helped redirect my energies away from the pursuit of an investment banking
career and into ending the AIDS epidemic.
During the last two years, I have learned a lot about AIDS. This knowledge,
acquired through reading and participation in scientific conferences on AIDS, has
enabled me to actively contribute to the solution of the AIDS epidemic. In May I
will be finishing my MBA, and I am planning to apply the skills learned in school to
the search for an answer. But I need your help, we need your help.
ACT UP/GOLDEN GATE is a non-partisan charitable organization committed
to ending the AIDS epidemic. Since the creation of ACT UPs all over the world,
much progress has been made in speeding up research and drug approval, and in
making experimental drugs available to those who need them.
The AIDS epidemic is unlike other diseases in that its brunt has been borne by
young people. Instead of giving up in despair, many people with AIDS (PWAs) have
become involved in being a part of the solution of this epidemic. People with AIDS
and AIDS activists are breaking historic new ground. Never before have those
affected by a devastating life-threatening disease organized to bring about change the
way science is conducted. Thanks to this active participation in the halls of science,
pressure has built for faster access to experimental treatments for people who are
failing standard therapies. Today, more than 11,000 people with AIDS who have
failed AZT are receiving DDI even though the drug has not yet been approved by
FDA bureaucrats. DDI is not a cure for AIDS, but it is keeping people alive while
waiting for more effective, less toxic drugs.
Since 1989, people with AIDS and AIDS activists have been key participants in
national and international AIDS conferences. ACT UP/GOLDEN GATE is looking
for sponsors willing to defray the cost of sending 10 people with AIDS and AIDS
activists to the three AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) meetings held each year,
and to the 7th International AIDS Conference that will take place in Florence (Italy)
between the 16th and the 21st of June.

22,25,26
28
Two types of nebulizers, ultrasonic and jet, have
been employed to deliver aerosolized pentamidine.
Ultrasonic nebulizers operate by generating an ultra-
high-frequency sound from a piezoelectric crystal that
creates a geyser from which particles are expelled.²
The particle size of aerosols from ultrasonic nebulizers
is a function of the frequency of the signal to the
piezoelectric crystal28 and of flowrates. A higher
frequency ultrasonic nebulizer will produce smaller
initial particles, but when flow through the nebulizer
is discontinuous, as with tidal breathing, larger
particles are created because the small particles rapidly
coalesce into larger particles.23 It will not be surprising
if different measurements of output and particle size
are reported, because of different operating conditions.
Jet nebulizers work by high-flow gas shearing liquid
strands from a thin layer of solution maintained by
surface tension. The liquid strands hit a baffle, and
a wide variety of particle sizes is created. The larger
particles generally fall by gravity and are reincor-
porated into the solution. Smaller particles can be
created by higher gas pressures. Due to the inherent
continuous flow, output, and particle-size distribution,
jet nebulizers are relatively more constant than
ultrasonic nebulizers.
28
Commercially available ultrasonic nebulizers
currently in use are the Fisoneb, Pulmosonic, and
Portosonic (Table 1).* The Fisoneb and Pulmosonic
both operate at a frequency of 1.3 mHz, which predicts
a MMAD of 4 to 6 μ.28 The Pulmosonic has been
reported to deliver few particles <2 μ and therefore
may be unsuitable for applications requiring high

yields to peripheral lung areas.
nebulizer is a 2.3-mHz ultrasonic nebulizer and may
offer the combination of a 1.3 μ MMAD with a
high output. Output and particle size of ultrasonic
nebulizers need to be periodically sampled, as the
frequency of the piezoelectric crystal may alter with
age.
28
Nebulizers are commercially available in the United
States that produce a MMAD between 0.25 and 2.0

way valves that control a drug reservoir, that allow
entrainment of room air in patients whose minute
ventilation is high, that act as a baffle to decrease
particle size, and that direct expired air to a filter
that scavenges remaining drug, preventing environ-
mental contamination. The Centimist is a similar
device with a larger reservoir but no expiratory filter.
The Aerotech II has internal baffles in the jet nebulizer
and therefore may allow recycling of the drug;
however, because it requires a high gas flowrate
between 10 and 15 L/min and lacks an aerosol
reservoir, much of the drug is not available to the
patient for inhalation. Experience with the Aerotech
II is limited. Although efficacy is not known,
anecdotal reports of coughing at high doses above
100 mg have led to use of a 40-mg dose for
prophylaxis studies (Tom Boylen MD: personal
communication.) Three factors could account for the
increased incidence of airway reactivity at higher
doses: increased flows from the higher inherent flow-
rate of the device, a larger particle size, or higher
output from the nebulizer. The Ultra Vent has a
MMAD of 0.25 p. 29 This would predict random
deposition by Brownian motion throughout the lung,
with most of the particles being exhaled.25,27
The present state of knowledge cannot allow
determination of the most effective device because
comparative pharmacokinetic studies have not been
conducted in human beings. The device should
maximize alveolar deposition and keep large-airway
deposition to a minimum because pentamidine
isethionate, containing a SO3 moiety, is an airway
irritant.30 The optimal particle size for alveolar
deposition is between 1 and 2 μ, with 1 μ achieving

two types of nebulizers, ultrasonic and jet, have
been employed to deliver aerosolized pentamidine.
ultrasonic nebulizers operate by generating an ultra-
high-frequency sound from a piezoelectric crystal that
creates a geyser from which particles are expelled.²
the particle size of aerosols from ultrasonic nebulizers
is a function of the frequency of the signal to the
piezoelectric crystal28 and of flowrates. a higher
frequency ultrasonic nebulizer will produce smaller
initial particles, but when flow through the nebulizer
is discontinuous, as with tidal breathing, larger
particles are created because the small particles rapidly
coalesce into larger particles.23 it will not be surprising
if different measurements of output and particle size
are reported, because of different operating conditions.
jet nebulizers work by high-flow gas shearing liquid
strands from a thin layer of solution maintained by
surface tension. the liquid strands hit a baffle, and
a wide variety of particle sizes is created. the larger
particles generally fall by gravity and are reincor-
porated into the solution. smaller particles can be
created by higher gas pressures. due to the inherent
continuous flow, output, and particle-size distribution,
jet nebulizers are relatively more constant than
ultrasonic nebulizers.
28
commercially available ultrasonic nebulizers
currently in use are the fisoneb, pulmosonic, and
portosonic (table 1).* the fisoneb and pulmosonic
both operate at a frequency of 1.3 mhz, which predicts
a mmad of 4 to 6 μ.28 the pulmosonic has been
reported to deliver few particles <2 μ and therefore
may be unsuitable for applications requiring high
28 the portosonic
yields to peripheral lung areas.
nebulizer is a 2.3-mhz ultrasonic nebulizer and may
offer the combination of a 1.3 μ mmad with a
high output. output and particle size of ultrasonic
nebulizers need to be periodically sampled, as the
frequency of the piezoelectric crystal may alter with
age.
28
nebulizers are commercially available in the united
states that produce a mmad between 0.25 and 2.0
(table 1). the respirgard ii, currently used in
studies at san francisco general hospital, has one-

respiratory care august '88 vol 33 no 8
way valves that control a drug reservoir, that allow
entrainment of room air in patients whose minute
ventilation is high, that act as a baffle to decrease
particle size, and that direct expired air to a filter
that scavenges remaining drug, preventing environ-
mental contamination. the centimist is a similar
device with a larger reservoir but no expiratory filter.
the aerotech ii has internal baffles in the jet nebulizer
and therefore may allow recycling of the drug;
however, because it requires a high gas flowrate
between 10 and 15 l/min and lacks an aerosol
reservoir, much of the drug is not available to the
patient for inhalation. experience with the aerotech
ii is limited. although efficacy is not known,
anecdotal reports of coughing at high doses above
100 mg have led to use of a 40-mg dose for
prophylaxis studies (tom boylen md: personal
communication.) three factors could account for the
increased incidence of airway reactivity at higher
doses: increased flows from the higher inherent flow-
rate of the device, a larger particle size, or higher
output from the nebulizer. the ultra vent has a
mmad of 0.25 p. 29 this would predict random
deposition by brownian motion throughout the lung,
with most of the particles being exhaled.25,27
the present state of knowledge cannot allow
determination of the most effective device because
comparative pharmacokinetic studies have not been
conducted in human beings. the device should
maximize alveolar deposition and keep large-airway
deposition to a minimum because pentamidine
isethionate, containing a so3 moiety, is an airway
irritant.30 the optimal particle size for alveolar
deposition is between 1 and 2 μ, with 1 μ achieving
more peripheral distribution and less airway
other features such as reservoirs,
distribution. 22,23,25-27
operating flowrates, and external filters may also be
important.
a pharmacokinetic study that allows estimates of
the dose of pentamidine needed in treatment trials
using the respirgard ii has been conducted in eight
patients with diffuse alveolar infiltrates undergoing
fiberoptic bronchoscopy for suspected pcp.³1
bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) sediment and
supernatant concentrations of pentamidine were
compared between 18 and 24 hours after admin-
istration of 4 mg/kg i.v (n = 3) and aerosolized

YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF FROM AIDS
FACTS
1. Infection by the AIDS virus will be a personal calamity for you:
o It is one of, or possibly THE most dangerous, virus of humans
-10% or more of those infected will die.
0
-25% or more will develop some AIDS-related conditions.
-An unknown number will develop brain damage.
All infected people are potentially infectious for life:
-All sexual partners are at risk of being infected.
2. The AIDS virus is spread only by sexual contact and blood (needle)
sharing, and NOT by casual contact.
3. YOU have the power to protect yourself.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROTECTING YOURSELF
If you are uninfected by the AIDS virus, the following recommendations are
made regarding safe sexual activity:
The safest is: No sexual contact.
Comment: This is a fool proof means by which to protect yourself
which is being followed by many. It does not mean that one
has to be celibate forever just until we have better
prevention tools.
If you want to have sex, you can be protected from infection by: Having
protected sex only with uninfected people.
Comment: ""Protected sex"" means sexual activity where no potentially
infectious body fluids contact non-skin covered surfaces of
the body. It means that a condom (rubber) is worn ALL OF THE
TIME. There is no mouth contact with genital areas (unless
protected with a condom) or anal area. No heavy (""French"")
kissing. A virus killing substance (like nonoxynol 9
containing spermacidal jelly) is used both inside and outside
of condoms. To be effective these rules must be followed 100%
of the time.
""Uninfected people"" means people who have been tested and
found to be AIDS virus antibody negative.
An alternative, although probably somewhat less save is: Protected sex
without regard to whether or not the person is un infected.
Comment: This should be quite safe if protective practices
(outlined above) are strictly adhered to 100% of the time.
Another alternative is: Unprotected sex only with uninfected people.

their immune systems monitored. If
their immune systems reach the criti-
cal danger point that places them at
high risk for Pneumocystis pneumonia,
they can use aerosol pentamidine to
ward off the pneumonia.
The decision of the agency, to be offi-
cially announced next week, was re-
ported yesterday by several newspa-
pers. The agency would not comment
on the prospects for full marketing ap-
proval of aerosol pentamidine.
Pneumocystis pneumonia ""is the
most common serious infection"" to
strike AIDS patients, said Dr. Ed-
ward M. Bernard of the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
New York. The once rare form of
pneumonia strikes more than half of
all AIDS patients and has been the
most common immediate cause of
death among people suffering from
acquired immune deficiency syn-
drome.
Dr. Bernard said most patients sur
vived their first bout with the disease
if they went to treatment centers that
are experienced in treating it. But
treatment involves three weeks of
hospitalization, and some patients
who have had the disease two or three
times are no longer able to tolerate
the powerful drugs used to treat it,
Dr. Bernard said.
The drug will be released under a
program involving investigational
new drugs for treatment, or treat-
ment I.N.D.'s. These drugs can be le-
gally prescribed, but their use must
be monitored and more data on the
drug's safety and effectiveness must
be accumulated before the drugs can
be licensed for general marketing.
The only drug licensed for use
against the AIDS virus itself, azido-
thymidine, or AZT, was also initially
released in late 1986 in an I.N.D. pro-
gram after initial studies showed it
prolonged life. The drug agency says
it has since taken steps to further
speed availability of promising drugs
against serious diseases. It has also
ruled that companies may charge pa-
tients for drugs distributed under the
program. But critics have com-
plained that the agency's policies re-
mained too restrictive.
Prevention of Pneumonia
Patients who have already had one
episode of Pneumocystis pneumonia
are especially likely to get it again,
said Dr. Gifford Leoung of San Fran-
cisco General Hospital and the Uni-
versity of California at San Francis-
co. He and his colleagues found that
45 percent of patients who develop the
pneumonia will get it again within
nine months if they do not take aero-
sol pentamidine to prevent it.
Preliminary evidence from Dr.
Leoung's group and others indicates
that aerosol pentamidine can prevent
a second attack of the pneumonia in
patients who have already had one
bout with the disease.
Although these studies did not
demonstrate that the drug also pre-
vents a first episode of the pneumo-
nia, the F.D.A. considered data from
a Federal study showing that patients
with seriously weakened immune
systems, those with counts of a type
of white blood cell called T-4 cells
below 200 per milliliter of blood, are
very likely to develop the pneumonia.
The agency suspects that those pa-
tients too would benefit from the
aerosol pentamidine and is making
the drug available to them.
Aerosol pentamidine has been
widely used over the last year or two
by patients in research programs,
'This could be a
landmark decision,'
an AIDS researcher
in Boston says.
and by some doctors and patients,
concentrated in the East and West
coasts, who have acted without Fed-
eral approval.
$70 a Vial
Pentamidine is made by LyphoMed
Inc. of Rosemont, Ill, which charges
$70 a vial for the drug, enough for one
treatment. Some patients have re-
ceived the drug at no cost in experi-
ments, but doctors charge patients
anywhere from $100 to $500 a treat-
ment, said Martin Delaney, a director
of Project Inform, a San Francisco-
based group that lobbies for speedier
approval of new drugs for AIDS pa-
tients..
The treatment involves breathing a
mist of pentamidine through a mask,
after the drug has been whipped into
small droplets by a special nebulizing
machine. The optimal schedule
treatments has not been determined;
many patients are treated twice a
month, while others inhale the drug
of
once a week or once a month. The
drug agency will recommend that pa-
tients take 300 milligrams every four
weeks.
Up to now, patients taking the aero-
sol treatment usually have traveled
to doctors' offices or to hospitals, al-
though some patients have purchased
their own nebulizers, which cost from
about $200 to $700, Mr. Delaney said.
Some insurance companies have
paio 1or aeroso pentamame, but
others have refused, arguing that this
use of the drug was not approved, and
patients have had to pay for the
monthly or twice-a-month treaments
out of their own pockets. A legal ex-
pert said yesterday that it was un-
clear whether the limited form of ap-
proval now being granted, which ex-
plicitly labels a drug as still experi-
mental, would force more insurance
companies to pay the cost.
Many Are Surprised
The agency's decision came as a
surprise to many researchers and ad-
vocates for AIDS patients who have
long argued that aerosol pentamidine
should be widely and legally avail-
able. The drug is now marketed for
use intravenously and by injection.
Some doctors have hesitated to use
aerosol pentamidine to prevent dis-
ease, waiting for more definitive data
showing that it was effective. And
others have used it only in patients
who have already had one bout with
Pneumocystis pneumonia.
""You can get aerosolized pentami-
dine in New York and San Francisco
with ease, but beyond that the ease
falls off quickly,"" Mr. Delaney said.
""A lot of doctors and hospitals have
been waiting until the F.D.A. ap-
proved it.""
To receive the drug through the
I.N.D. program, doctors will call Ly-
phoMed and request it for thier pa-
tie according to an F.D.A. official.
If the patients are eligible under the
guidelines of the 1.N.D. program, the
company will send the drug. The doc-
tor will report back to the company
on the clinical progress of the pa-
tients taking the drug. LyphoMed de-
clined to say whether it would charge
for the drug, adding that it would
make that announcement next week
when the treament 1.N.D. is formally
announced. An official of the drug
agency said the company would set
up a special hot line for doctors seek-
ing the drug and would announce the
number next week.
In making its decision, the agency
relied heavily on a study directed by
Dr. Donald Abrams and Dr. Leoung
of San Francisco General Hospital,
which involved 408 people infected
with the AIDS virus and 75 doctors in
San Francisco. About 250 of the par-
ticipants in the study had had at least
one bout with Pneumocystis pneumo-
nia, and the others had either Kapo-
si's sarcoma, a cancer that often in-
fects AIDS patients, or other illnesses
that are commmon to carriers of the
AIDS virus who have weakened im-
mune systems.
The patients were randomly as-
signed to take one of three doses of
aerosol pentamidine, once every two
weeks or once a month. The research-
ers found that the patients who had
already had pneumonia had signifi-
cantly fewer subsequent bouts with
pneumonia than expected. But they
could not determine whether the drug
was equally effective in patients who
had not already had pnuemonia.
Uncertainty Over Effect
Dr. Leoung said the uncertainty
was because the researchers did not
know how likely those patients were
to develop the pneumonia in the first
place, and so they could not estimate
how effective they were in preventing
it. The researchers said they felt they
would not be able to find patients will-
ing to serve as a comparison group,
taking an inert substance rather than
the drug.",0.9850170612335204,"continued from page al

widely used over the last year or two
by patients in research programs,
'this could be a
landmark decision,'
an aids researcher
in boston says.
and by some doctors and patients,
concentrated in the east and west
coasts, who have acted without fed-
eral approval.
$70 a vial
pentamidine is made by lyphomed
inc. of rosemont, ill, which charges
$70 a vial for the drug, enough for one
treatment. some patients have re-
ceived the drug at no cost in experi-
ments, but doctors charge patients
anywhere from $100 to $500 a treat-
ment, said martin delaney, a director
of project inform, a san francisco-
based group that lobbies for speedier
approval of new drugs for aids pa-
tients..
the treatment involves breathing a
mist of pentamidine through a mask,
after the drug has been whipped into
small droplets by a special nebulizing
machine. the optimal schedule
treatments has not been determined;
many patients are treated twice a
month, while others inhale the drug
of
once a week or once a month. the
drug agency will recommend that pa-
tients take 300 milligrams every four
weeks.
up to now, patients taking the aero-
sol treatment usually have traveled
to doctors' offices or to hospitals, al-
though some patients have purchased
their own nebulizers, which cost from
about $200 to $700, mr. delaney said.
some insurance companies have
paio 1or aeroso pentamame, but
others have refused, arguing that this
use of the drug was not approved, and
patients have had to pay for the
monthly or twice-a-month treaments
out of their own pockets. a legal ex-
pert said yesterday that it was un-
clear whether the limited form of ap-
proval now being granted, which ex-
plicitly labels a drug as still experi-
mental, would force more insurance
companies to pay the cost.
many are surprised
the agency's decision came as a
surprise to many researchers and ad-
vocates for aids patients who have
long argued that aerosol pentamidine
should be widely and legally avail-
able. the drug is now marketed for
use intravenously and by injection.
some doctors have hesitated to use
aerosol pentamidine to prevent dis-
ease, waiting for more definitive data
showing that it was effective. and
others have used it only in patients
who have already had one bout with
pneumocystis pneumonia.
""you can get aerosolized pentami-
dine in new york and san francisco
with ease, but beyond that the ease
falls off quickly,"" mr. delaney said.
""a lot of doctors and hospitals have
been waiting until the f.d.a. ap-
proved it.""
to receive the drug through the
i.n.d. program, doctors will call ly-
phomed and request it for thier pa-
tie according to an f.d.a. official.
if the patients are eligible under the
guidelines of the 1.n.d. program, the
company will send the drug. the doc-
tor will report back to the company
on the clinical progress of the pa-
tients taking the drug. lyphomed de-
clined to say whether it would charge
for the drug, adding that it would
make that announcement next week
when the treament 1.n.d. is formally
announced. an official of the drug
agency said the company would set
up a special hot line for doctors seek-
ing the drug and would announce the
number next week.
in making its decision, the agency
relied heavily on a study directed by
dr. donald abrams and dr. leoung
of san francisco general hospital,
which involved 408 people infected
with the aids virus and 75 doctors in
san francisco. about 250 of the par-
ticipants in the study had had at least
one bout with pneumocystis pneumo-
nia, and the others had either kapo-
si's sarcoma, a cancer that often in-
fects aids patients, or other illnesses
that are commmon to carriers of the
aids virus who have weakened im-
mune systems.
the patients were randomly as-
signed to take one of three doses of
aerosol pentamidine, once every two
weeks or once a month. the research-
ers found that the patients who had
already had pneumonia had signifi-
cantly fewer subsequent bouts with
pneumonia than expected. but they
could not determine whether the drug
was equally effective in patients who
had not already had pnuemonia.
uncertainty over effect
dr. leoung said the uncertainty
was because the researchers did not
know how likely those patients were
to develop the pneumonia in the first
place, and so they could not estimate
how effective they were in preventing
it. the researchers said they felt they
would not be able to find patients will-
ing to serve as a comparison group,
taking an inert substance rather than
the drug.","continued from page al
their immune systems monitored. if
their immune systems reach the criti-
cal danger point that places them at
high risk for pneumocystis pneumonia,
they can use aerosol pentamidine to
ward off the pneumonia.
the decision of the agency, to be offi-
cially announced next week, was re-
ported yesterday by several newspa-
pers. the agency would not comment
on the prospects for full marketing ap-
proval of aerosol pentamidine.
pneumocystis pneumonia ""is the
most common serious infection"" to
strike aids patients, said dr. ed-
ward m. bernard of the memorial
sloan-kettering cancer center in
new york. the once rare form of
pneumonia strikes more than half of
all aids patients and has been the
most common immediate cause of
death among people suffering from
acquired immune deficiency syn-
drome.
dr. bernard said most patients sur
vived their first bout with the disease
if they went to treatment centers that
are experienced in treating it. but
treatment involves three weeks of
hospitalization, and some patients
who have had the disease two or three
times are no longer able to tolerate
the powerful drugs used to treat it,
dr. bernard said.
the drug will be released under a
program involving investigational
new drugs for treatment, or treat-
ment i.n.d.'s. these drugs can be le-
gally prescribed, but their use must
be monitored and more data on the
drug's safety and effectiveness must
be accumulated before the drugs can
be licensed for general marketing.
the only drug licensed for use
against the aids virus itself, azido-
thymidine, or azt, was also initially
released in late 1986 in an i.n.d. pro-
gram after initial studies showed it
prolonged life. the drug agency says
it has since taken steps to further
speed availability of promising drugs
against serious diseases. it has also
ruled that companies may charge pa-
tients for drugs distributed under the
program. but critics have com-
plained that the agency's policies re-
mained too restrictive.
prevention of pneumonia
patients who have already had one
episode of pneumocystis pneumonia
are especially likely to get it again,
said dr. gifford leoung of san fran-
cisco general hospital and the uni-
versity of california at san francis-
co. he and his colleagues found that
45 percent of patients who develop the
pneumonia will get it again within
nine months if they do not take aero-
sol pentamidine to prevent it.
preliminary evidence from dr.
leoung's group and others indicates
that aerosol pentamidine can prevent
a second attack of the pneumonia in
patients who have already had one
bout with the disease.
although these studies did not
demonstrate that the drug also pre-
vents a first episode of the pneumo-
nia, the f.d.a. considered data from
a federal study showing that patients
with seriously weakened immune
systems, those with counts of a type
of white blood cell called t-4 cells
below 200 per milliliter of blood, are
very likely to develop the pneumonia.
the agency suspects that those pa-
tients too would benefit from the
aerosol pentamidine and is making
the drug available to them.

widely used over the last year or two

small (less than 1 in 100) unless the individual is an IV
drug user, a prostitute, or a sexual contact of homosexual

some protection method (as outlined above) for heterosexual
people having sex outside of primary relationships. In

Dear Marc, Neil, Bob, Larry and Bob,
One of the most difficult subjects that we discussed in Los Angeles was
sexual practices recommendations designed to stop transmission of the AIDS
virus. Those recommendations, regardless of how difficult for us to make,
will form the corner stone of the AIDS control program under design. We, as
a small but important group must agree on these recommendations.
GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN, Governor
October 22, 1985
To further the consensus building process, I have drafted the enclosed
recommendations and have chosen you as a sub-group to have a first cut on
modifications.
A few things have been done that deserve special comment:
1. I have tried to make the recommendations unisex to avoid any
""pro-gay sex"" comments from the less-than-modern politicians.
2. I tried to integrate all comments from the LA meeting, but, in
the unisex stance, could not include, ""we are losing the battle"".
3. I purposely tried to find a phrase other than ""safe sex"" and used
""protected sex"". Comments?
4. As part of ""protected sex"", I have singled out oral sex as
dangerous unless a condom is used. I feel strongly regarding this but
realize that latex has an unpleasant taste.
5. I think wisdom (killing virus and killing lymphocytes) should make
us bite the bullet on nonoxynol 9, so I have included it in ""protected
sex"".
6. Although the relative efficacies of protected sex and test-linked
sex are not known, I chose to put protected sex first and left test-
linked sex as an alternative.
Sincerely
Please scribble on this quickly and get it back to me for the next revision.
Then we can circulate it to a larger audience.

one of the most difficult subjects that we discussed in los angeles was
sexual practices recommendations designed to stop transmission of the aids
virus. those recommendations, regardless of how difficult for us to make,
will form the corner stone of the aids control program under design. we, as
a small but important group must agree on these recommendations.
george deukmejian, governor
october 22, 1985
to further the consensus building process, i have drafted the enclosed
recommendations and have chosen you as a sub-group to have a first cut on
modifications.
a few things have been done that deserve special comment:
1. i have tried to make the recommendations unisex to avoid any
""pro-gay sex"" comments from the less-than-modern politicians.
2. i tried to integrate all comments from the la meeting, but, in
the unisex stance, could not include, ""we are losing the battle"".
3. i purposely tried to find a phrase other than ""safe sex"" and used
""protected sex"". comments?
4. as part of ""protected sex"", i have singled out oral sex as
dangerous unless a condom is used. i feel strongly regarding this but
realize that latex has an unpleasant taste.
5. i think wisdom (killing virus and killing lymphocytes) should make
us bite the bullet on nonoxynol 9, so i have included it in ""protected
sex"".
6. although the relative efficacies of protected sex and test-linked
sex are not known, i chose to put protected sex first and left test-
linked sex as an alternative.
sincerely
please scribble on this quickly and get it back to me for the next revision.
then we can circulate it to a larger audience.

standard deviation is a unitless measurement
calculated by dividing the MMAD by particle size
at the 84th percentile of the total mass.²3 Generally,
a geometric standard deviation greater than 2 indicates
a wide range of particle sizes.23 The size range of
pentamidine aerosols that have been used clinically
has varied from 0.25 to greater than 12 μ (Table
1).

Aerosol deposition is determined by three inter-
dependent processes-inertial impaction, gravita-
tional sedimentation, and Brownian motion-each
affecting different size ranges of particles.
Inertial impaction occurs at areas of nonlaminar flow
in the oropharynx and large central airways.
Nonlaminar conditions are created by turns and
bifurcations or increased flowrates. Larger particles
generally impact from inertia in the oropharynx;
almost all particles > 10μ do not reach the alveoli,
and most are impacted in the oropharynx. Likewise,

deposition, causes particles < 0.5 to deposit

Aerosolized Pentamidine for Treatment and Prophylaxis
of Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia: An Update
Kevin J Corkery BS RCP RRT, John M Luce MD, and A Bruce Montgomery MD
Introduction
The rapid increase in numbers of cases of
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients
with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) has led to a search for effective and less
toxic antipneumocystosis therapy and prophylaxis.
This short review is intended to summarize recent
developments regarding aerosolized pentamidine and
inspire further research in this promising modality.
Background
The first reports of P. carinii causing what was
then known as interstitial plasma cell pneumonia
originated in central Europe in the 1940's in infants
suffering from malnutrition. Subsequently, PCP was
diagnosed in patients with impaired host immunity,
leading to the classification of the organism as an
opportunist. With few exceptions, PCP continued
to be a sporadic opportunistic infection involving

Service, University of California at San Francisco General
Hospital, San Francisco, California. Dr Luce is Associate Professor
of Medicine and Anesthesia, University of California, San
Francisco, and Associate Director, Medical-Surgical Intensive
Care Unit, San Francisco General Hospital. Dr Montgomery
is Assistant Professor of Medicine, University of California, San
Francisco, Chest Service, San Francisco General Hospital.

Hospital, San Francisco CA 94110.
mainly patients who had lymphomas or leukemias
or who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
Beginning in 1979, however, the epidemiology of PCP
changed drastically with the development of the AIDS
epidemic. Since that year, more than 49,000 AIDS
cases have been reported to the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC). P. carinii pneumonia is the most
common life-threatening opportunistic infection
reported among patients with AIDS. It is the initial
opportunistic infection in 65% of HIV-infected
patients and occurs in 20% of patients whose diagnosis
of AIDS has been established by another process.
An analysis of past trends projects a cumulative AIDS
incidence of 270,000 by 1991, with 51,000 new cases
occurring in that year alone. Hence, it is projected
that, by 1991, more than 173,000 cases of PCP will
have occurred in the United States alone.
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients
may have protean manifestations but classically
presents with symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea.'
Diagnostic tests characteristically reveal arterial
hypoxemia, diffuse radiographic infiltrates, and
evidence of restrictive lung disease. Unlike common
pathogens that cause bacterial pneumonia, P. carinii
is an extracellular protozoan that inhabits predom-
inantly the alveolar spaces, with close approximation
to the surfaces of alveolar epithelial cells or alveolar
macrophages. Extrapulmonary P. carinii infections
are rare, suggesting that the alveolar environment is
usually necessary for growth of the pathogen.""
Optimal therapy would produce adequate antipneu-
mocystosis drug levels in alveoli while limiting
systemic side effects, this being the theoretical
advantage of aerosol therapy that targets the lungs.

Dear Mr. Coppock:
Thank you for your letter of March 15, 1989.
The Prudential has not changed it's policy on covering aerosolize
pentamidine. We have always considered it an experimental treatment. Your
treatments were paid for for the fourteen months by Prudential Plus because of
our error. Your claims were processed by someone who either was not aware of
what treatment was being given, or was not aware of our policy. We have paid
for thousands of dollars of treatment which we should not have done. We
apologize for our error.

The American system for approving new drugs and treatments for wide use has in
the past saved our patients from widespread ill effects that were seen in
European countries after introduction of new treatments through their less
rigorous approval mechanism. The FDA, other insurance companies, and The
Prudential are doing their best to streamline their approval mechanisms in the
face of the AIDS epidemic, but these changes are difficult and certainly not
nearly as rapid as many AIDS patients and their physicians would wish. I can
only assure you that The Prudential's position is not taken as a money saving
measure. As you yourself mentioned aerosolized pentamidine, if it is
effective in preventing the onset of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, will
likely prevent long and expensive hospitalizations and lower overall health
care costs.

WHAT IS AIDS?
AIDS is a disease which attacks the body's
ability to fight off some illnesses. It is caused by a
virus (germ) spread by sexual contact or sharing
needles when shooting drugs. Half of the people
who have AIDS have died. There is no cure for
AIDS. Prevention is the only way to stop this
disease.
People can be infected with the AIDS virus and
look healthy. However, they can pass the virus on
to another without either person knowing it. It is
difficult to know who is infected; we urge
everyone to take the simple precautions listed
below to protect yourself always.
YOU CAN GET AIDS
FROM SOMEONE WHO IS INFECTED
WITH THE AIDS VIRUS:
If you have intercourse without a rubber.
If you have mouth to rectum contact or fist in
rectum contact.
If you use someone else's sex toys, such as
vibrators or dildoes.
If you swallow urine (piss), semen (cum), or
feces (shit) or allow them in your mouth.
If you have received contaminated blood from a
blood transfusion between 1979 and 1985.
If you shoot up drugs with someone else's
needles, ""works"", ""rig"", or ""tools"".
●
If you have sex and take inside yourself the
blood or cum of someone who does the things
listed above.
IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO GET AIDS
FROM SOMEONE INFECTED
WITH THE AIDS VIRUS:
If you swallow fluid from the vagina (it is
unknown whether this fluid contains the AIDS
virus).
If you have anal/vaginal intercourse with a
condom (having a condom break during anal/
vaginal intercourse).
If you have oral sex and stop sucking before
partner cums (pre-cum contains the
If you French kiss.
YOU CANNOT GET AIDS:
• From shaking hands, hugging, social kissing,
crying, sneezing or coughing.
• From swimming pools, hot tubs, restaurants,
elevators, or the air.
• From sharing drinking glasses or straws, silver-
ware, or dishes.
• From toilet seats, door knobs, typewriters, or
telephones.
• From body massages, masturbation (jacking off),
body rubbing, dry humping, or light S&M play
(no bleeding).
WOMEN
If a woman is infected with the AIDS virus she can
pass it to her unborn child. The baby will have a
50-50 chance of being born with AIDS. Think care-
fully if you plan on becoming pregnant. Get more
information if you're unsure about whether you
may be infected.
WARNING SIGNS-Symptoms of AIDS
Many AIDS symptoms are also symptoms of other
diseases that are not AIDS, such as colds or the flu.
But the AIDS symptoms last longer and are very
extreme.
SYMPTOMS INCLUDE:
• Being very tired for a long time for ""no reason"".
• Fevers, shaking chills, or soaking night sweats
for ""no reason"".
Weight loss of more than ten pounds in one
month for ""no reason"".
• Swollen glands in your arm pits or under your
chin or between your legs, for more than two
months.
Frequent diarrhea.
Frequent white spots or uncommon mouth
sores.
Frequent dry cough, without having a cold or
the flu, especially if you have trouble catching
your breath.
Pink, purple, or brown spots or bumps that are
darker in color than skin surrounding these
spots; on persons with darker skin color the
spots again will be darker than normal skin
color. These spots can be on or under the skin,
or inside the mouth, nose, eyelids, or rectum.

that do not heal, do not go away and are often
harder than the skin around them.",0.9794324636459352,"aids is striking people of color. it is not limited to gay white men.

treatment
The Prudential Insurance Company of America recently notified
clients with AIDS, ARC, or who are HIV-positive, that they will no
longer pay for treatments for Aerosolized Pentamidine, an extremely
promising treatment that preliminary study figures indicate can
minimize recurrence or prevent initial onset of Pneumocystis Carinii
Pneumonia. As reported in the Bay Area Reporter (March 30, 1989),
the carrier sent out form letters informing clients receiving the
treatments that it was discontinuing payment for the treatments,
claiming that it was unproven and experimental, citing Aerosolized
Pentamidine's status as an Investigational New Drug under FDA
guidelines. The letter also indicated that other carriers may
be following suit.
According to local hospital sources, who wished to remain
anonymous, the exact number of patients receiving the treatment
could not be revealed due to confidentiality concerns. The same
sources did indicate that Prudential, while the primary carrier
instigating the action, was not the only major U.S. carrier involved.
Other carriers are either re-examining their policies or have already
begun terminating benefits for the treatments.
In an effort to collect information on the number of people
affected or possibly affected by the actions of these carriers,
and to determine the best approach in dealing with these carriers,
a grass-roots group has been formed, named PANT (Pentamidine
Advocates for Necessary Treatment) in San Francisco.
Anyone who has been denied coverage for this treatment is urged
to contact PANT at (415) 553-4041, or write them at 3909 17th St., No.3,

Medical Director
Dear Dr. Small:
BAPHR, a membership association of several hundred physicians
and dentists, urges you and Prudential Insurance to reconsider
the policy of not reimbursing costs of prescribed pentamidine
mist therapy.
The very much respected San Francisco County Community Consortium
has been one of the co-principal investigators of the recent
trial of aerosolized pentamadine and has demonstrated the
efficacy of this modality. It is obvious that aerosolized
pentamadine 300mg inhaled once monthly has been effective
in preventing episodes of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
and is cost effective in the overall management and treatment
of individuals with HIV infection. This therapy is rapidly
becoming the standard of care for individuals who are
immuno-compromised.
Again, we urge Prudential to reconsider its position and adopt a
policy of reimbursing this cost effective treatment IND as well
as the non-research patient care costs of this therapy.
Thank you for your consideration.
Yours very truly,

Hi Folks, Here are my agenda items for the upcoming board meeting:
REPORTS
Tom O'Connor's Book
Spanish language version - It turns out that the rights are owned by Ahmed
Gonzalez-Nunez and Tom's father, not by Tom's estate, so they will not be given
to us.
Updating - The executors would like to see it updated.
Distributing the remaining books - There are 62 cases of 28 books each that will be
sent, from the warehouse, to various AIDS service organizations around the U.S.
If
you know of any organizations that would like to receive a case or two, give a
written list to Richard C. The estate will donate the books and the amount of
shipping costs to us, so that we can pay the shipping bill and then claim the value
of the books as a donation to other organizations.
• Merrill Lynch
Funds will be transferred the week of 9/14 from the Working Assets fund to the
new Merrill Lynch account. Account information and procedures are available for
review.
Signers will need to sign a letter to Merrill Lynch.
✓.
• Financial information will be available and up to date.
OTHER
✓ I need Enrique's address, phone number and fax number.
There are a couple other items I would like to discuss.

Dear Mr.
Arthur Small, M.D.
Medical Director
Your physician has prescribed Pentamidine by inhalation for you.
This medication has been well proven as a treatment for pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia when used intravenously. It has been widely used as an aerosol by
inhalation in an attempt to prevent further episodes of pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia; however, no one has yet proven that it is effective when used in
this way. There are several research projects currently underway attempting
to demonstrate its effectiveness. Until these experiments are completed and
the full risks and effectiveness of the aerosolized pentamidine are known, it
is still considered an experimental drug. Experimental treatments are not
Icovered by your Prudential Plus insurance policy, nor by most other insurance
policies.

For Pentamidine Mist
Prudential Says Preventive Treatment
Experimental; Will Pay For IV Treatment Only
by Dennis McMillan
A man with AIDS is up in arms because Prudential Insurance has cancelled coverage of
his aerosol pentamidine treatments. David Anthony Coppock, who was due to receive 14
months of prescribed pentamidine mist therapy, was sent a form letter announcing Pruden-
tial's policy. He is now waging a personal war against the insurance company, starting off with
a letter campaign.
Since the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has given aerosolis-
ed pentamidine the status of an
Investigational New Drug (IND),
Prudential Insurance Company
of America has apparently been
sending out form letters to clients
who use the treatment, stating,
""under this provision, an ex-
perimental drug can be sold by
the manufacturer outside the
confines of a strict research pro-
tocol, and while this policy by the
FDA does make [the drug] more
widely available, it does not
change its status as an IND.""
The letter stated that an excep-
tion existed for the intravenous
form of the medication as a pro-
ven treatment for pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, but that the
FDA has not yet accepted final
proof of the aerosol's effec-
tiveness in its current status.
Coppock pointed out that the
IV form of the drug is far more
expensive than the mist form and
is used for treatment of the dis-
ease. The aerosol form is used to
prevent the disease from develop-
ing.
The letter then flatly stated
that since the aerosol is an ex-
perimental drug, such treatments
""are not covered by the Pruden-
tial Plus insurance policy, nor by
most other insurance policies.""
It went on to say that they will
be watching the progress of
research of aerosol and will add
its coverage ""as soon as it has
been proven safe and effective""
Coppock, with a very low count
of 13 T-cells, responded angrily to
Prudential's Feb. 28 letter,
writing to Dr. Arthur Small,
medical director of Prudential.
Coppock wrote: ""It is downright
shameful that this semantic shift
in the way the FDA views the
drug is so quickly capitalized
upon by insurance carriers to
deny benefits""
He told the doctor that he
could not imagine going more
than six months without the mist
until he developed pneumocystis.
""I am extremely saddened to
see you, a physician who has pre-
sumably taken the Hypocratic
oath to preserve life, should con-
spire with bureaucrats to endorse
such a decision,"" Coppeck wrote.
Small wrote back two days
later that Prudential has not
changed its policy, but there had
been a clerical error in ever hav
ing paid for his mist treatments
in the first place.
Food
Nopp
He
Coppook said that he knows of
other people who have received
this form letter. He said that the
receptionist for Pacific
Presbyterian stated he is not the
only one to complain and that
other insurance carriers are ac-
ting similarly.
When the B.A.R. contacted
Pacific Presbyterian, they were
unable to reveal the number of
clients affected by Prudential's
policy because of the privacy act.
Ida Escarda, area supervisor of
the representatives who handle
insurance coverage, said that she
understood that other insurance
companies would likely follow
suit.
National Gay Rights Advocates
said they are looking into the
matter and plan to take legal ac-
tion against any carriers who
adopt this policy of non-coverage
of the mist therapy.
Dr. Small declined to speak
over the phone concerning the
policy, but sent a copy of the form
letter stating, ""Enclosed is the
language sent to our members
impacted by this policy.""
Coppock encouraged concern-
ed people to write Prudential In-
surance Company of America at
1400 Fashion Island Blvd., Suite
210, San Mateo, CA 94404.

for pentamidine mist
prudential says preventive treatment
experimental; will pay for iv treatment only
by dennis mcmillan
a man with aids is up in arms because prudential insurance has cancelled coverage of
his aerosol pentamidine treatments. david anthony coppock, who was due to receive 14
months of prescribed pentamidine mist therapy, was sent a form letter announcing pruden-
tial's policy. he is now waging a personal war against the insurance company, starting off with
a letter campaign.
since the food and drug ad-
ministration has given aerosolis-
ed pentamidine the status of an
investigational new drug (ind),
prudential insurance company
of america has apparently been
sending out form letters to clients
who use the treatment, stating,
""under this provision, an ex-
perimental drug can be sold by
the manufacturer outside the
confines of a strict research pro-
tocol, and while this policy by the
fda does make [the drug] more
widely available, it does not
change its status as an ind.""
the letter stated that an excep-
tion existed for the intravenous
form of the medication as a pro-
ven treatment for pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, but that the
fda has not yet accepted final
proof of the aerosol's effec-
tiveness in its current status.
coppock pointed out that the
iv form of the drug is far more
expensive than the mist form and
is used for treatment of the dis-
ease. the aerosol form is used to
prevent the disease from develop-
ing.
the letter then flatly stated
that since the aerosol is an ex-
perimental drug, such treatments
""are not covered by the pruden-
tial plus insurance policy, nor by
most other insurance policies.""
it went on to say that they will
be watching the progress of
research of aerosol and will add
its coverage ""as soon as it has
been proven safe and effective""
coppock, with a very low count
of 13 t-cells, responded angrily to
prudential's feb. 28 letter,
writing to dr. arthur small,
medical director of prudential.
coppock wrote: ""it is downright
shameful that this semantic shift
in the way the fda views the
drug is so quickly capitalized
upon by insurance carriers to
deny benefits""
he told the doctor that he
could not imagine going more
than six months without the mist
until he developed pneumocystis.
""i am extremely saddened to
see you, a physician who has pre-
sumably taken the hypocratic
oath to preserve life, should con-
spire with bureaucrats to endorse
such a decision,"" coppeck wrote.
small wrote back two days
later that prudential has not
changed its policy, but there had
been a clerical error in ever hav
ing paid for his mist treatments
in the first place.

coppook said that he knows of

Regarding the safe. Two distinct keys are required to open it. One
key is kept hidden in the office. There is only one copy of it. Richard W.,
Lewin and Ilene know where it is. There are two copies of the other key.
Currently Richard W. and Lewin keep them at all times. I recommend that
Lewin's key go to Matthew.
I have made myself available for consultation after my departure.
There is at least one item which I am scheduled to help out with - the
quarterly taxes in January. I would like to get paid with free product,
which could be rung up through the cash register as usual, with a 99%
discount. Richard W. and I could keep track of the balance due.

the Operations Committee. I suggest Richard W. and Matthew both be on it,
with one board member.
I am sending the October Income/Expense reports and Balance

an I ask you a personal question?"" the woman sit-
cumstance ventured, eyeing my book at intermission.
""Do you read in bed?"" ""All the time,"" I replied,
""especially books about sex - safe sex - with
pictures."" I was referring, of course, to Making It: A
Woman's Guide to Sex in the Age of AIDS.
Had intermission lasted a little
longer, I would have gone on to
tell my somewhat bewildered
companion that authors Cindy
Patton and Janis Kelly have deft-
ly woven a serious discussion of
AIDS transmission and preven-
tion into a lively and often
humorous booklet (in Spanish
and English) that doubles as a
showcase for Alison Bechdel (of
""Dykes to Watch Out For""
fame).
The book's practical tips on
minimizing risk and enjoying sex
in bisexual, lesbian and straight
relationships are explicitly and
colloquially worded (and lots of
fun to read). The authors tell you
everything you need to know
about condoms and dental
dams, and include safer sex
guidelines for IV drug users and
women in the sex industry.
For lesbians who have
watched with empathy and con-
cern as the epidemic escalated
among gay men but felt risk-free
by sheer virtue of their political
identification as lesbians, Patton
and Kelly debunk the fallacy that
AIDS is not their problem: ""Re-
member that risk comes from
what you do, not how you label
yourself.... An epidemic starts
somewhere, and it takes time for
the virus to move from one com-
munity to the next. Women who
have sex primarily with women
just happen to be the last sexual
group for the virus to reach.""
In the final analysis, the best
defense, as the AIDS Founda-
tion likes to say, is information.
To that I would add: the best in-
formation is nonjudgmental,
sexually explicit, politically
astute and culturally sensitive.
You'll get a healthy dose of all
that in Making It.
Diane Richardson, a lesbian
and social psychologist, employs
a decidedly less playful approach
in Women and AIDS, billed by its
publisher as ""the first feminist
response to the challenge of the
AIDS epidemic."" An excellent
and comprehensive book, Wom-
en and AIDS offers us a sweep-
ing view of the epidemic and its
impact on diverse communities
of women.
The book covers safer sex
practices in lesbian and hetero-
sexual relationships with
chapters that reiterate all the
now-familiar guidelines and a
few new ones as well: Richard-
son suggests, for example, that
using a cervical cap or
diaphragm to collect menstrual
blood may make sex during a
women's period safer in both
male-to-female and woman-to-
woman contact. In addition, the
author's sensitive and exhaustive
treatment of lesbian concerns
around the epidemic reveals as
much about tensions, prejudices
and politics in the lesbian com-
munity as it does about the low
infection rate of gay women with
AIDS:
Historically, there has been
tension between the lesbian com-
munity and gay men. Neverthe-
less, many lesbians have played
an important role in the develop-
ment of AIDS organizations,
fundraising and other forms of
AIDS-related work....
Equally, there are lesbians who,
while they may sympathize with
gay men over AIDS, feel it is im-
portant that they put their time
and energy into issues they feel
are of more direct relevance to
women, and more especially to
other lesbians. Some lesbians
feel angry that gay men, who
have previously shown little in-
terest or involvement in issues
that concern women, now expect
lesbians to support them.
She ends with a vision of the
challenge that the epidemic holds
for all of us. Those of us who
have struggled over the years to
diminish the effects of a
moralistic society on women's
sexuality now have a golden op-
development of new meanings
portunity to encourage the
for sex which do not focus ex-
clusively on the act of inter-
course. Ultimately, Richardson
leaves few stones unturned in her
coverage of AIDS transmission
and prevention in Women and
AIDS, and all that is left to the
reader's imagination are the
many ways to enjoy the safer sex
she advocates.
The same, unfortunately, can
not be said for The Real Truth
About Women and AIDS: How
to Eliminate the Risks Without
Giving Up Love and Sex.
In a manner reminiscent of
Masters' and Johnson's much-
criticized new book, physician
and sex therapist Helen Singer
Kaplan subjects the reader to
hysterical tirades on the fallibili-
ty of condoms, the untrust-
worthy nature of high-risk men
and the need for obsessive testing
and retesting for the HIV an-
tibody. A Holocaust survivor
who likens the AIDS epidemic to
mass exterminations by the
Nazis, Kaplan's stated objective
is for every women ""to protect
herself and her yet unborn
babies"" from infection.
Hence, the only acceptable,
low-risk sex in Kaplan's book is
""dry sex,"" sex with confirmed
monogamous partners, sex with
someone you have known for a
long time (""perhaps you grew up
with him""), or sex with men who
have a confirmed negative an-
tibody status such as those
belonging to ""reputable AIDS-
free [singles'] clubs."" So much
for Holocaust analogies.

Condoms, although they do
reduce the risk of HIV transmis-
sion, should only be used under a
few ""special circumstances,""
argues Kaplan, such as by IV
drug users, homosexual men,
men who frequent prostitutes
and sailors on leave in African
ports.
Later, in a chapter rather
euphemistically entitled ""Great
Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS,""
Kaplan exhorts us to be mindful
of even the most remote possibil-
ity of transmission:
The rule is ""keep it dry."" If
you should ""wet"" each other,
you must get up at once and wash
any part of your body that has
been in contact with potentially
infected fluid. Scrub with soap
and water in addition to

sexuality now have a golden op-
development of new meanings
portunity to encourage the
for sex which do not focus ex-
clusively on the act of inter-
course. ultimately, richardson
leaves few stones unturned in her
coverage of aids transmission
and prevention in women and
aids, and all that is left to the
reader's imagination are the
many ways to enjoy the safer sex
she advocates.
the same, unfortunately, can
not be said for the real truth
about women and aids: how
to eliminate the risks without
giving up love and sex.
in a manner reminiscent of
masters' and johnson's much-
criticized new book, physician
and sex therapist helen singer
kaplan subjects the reader to
hysterical tirades on the fallibili-
ty of condoms, the untrust-
worthy nature of high-risk men
and the need for obsessive testing
and retesting for the hiv an-
tibody. a holocaust survivor
who likens the aids epidemic to
mass exterminations by the
nazis, kaplan's stated objective
is for every women ""to protect
herself and her yet unborn
babies"" from infection.
hence, the only acceptable,
low-risk sex in kaplan's book is
""dry sex,"" sex with confirmed
monogamous partners, sex with
someone you have known for a
long time (""perhaps you grew up
with him""), or sex with men who
have a confirmed negative an-
tibody status such as those
belonging to ""reputable aids-
free [singles'] clubs."" so much
for holocaust analogies.

unprotected vaginal, anal or
oral intercourse with a high-risk
male, a stranger or a known car-
rier of the virus she grimly terms
""suicidal sex,"" and proceeds to
inundate the reader with horror
stories.

condoms, although they do
reduce the risk of hiv transmis-
sion, should only be used under a
few ""special circumstances,""
argues kaplan, such as by iv
drug users, homosexual men,
men who frequent prostitutes
and sailors on leave in african
ports.
later, in a chapter rather
euphemistically entitled ""great
safe sex in the age of aids,""
kaplan exhorts us to be mindful
of even the most remote possibil-
ity of transmission:
the rule is ""keep it dry."" if
you should ""wet"" each other,
you must get up at once and wash
any part of your body that has
been in contact with potentially
infected fluid. scrub with soap

Recommendations and Agenda Items for OpCom and Board
for the Board Meeting of Tuesday, 12/15
from Richard Copeland
Recommendations
I strongly recommend the following:
that Matthew be given a raise immediately. The duties that he is
performing are worth much more than $8.50/hr. And relative to Richard
and Judy, it is low. If we had hired a new person for the same duties, the
starting wage would probably be higher than that. I suggest a raise to at
least $9.25/hr.
that Judy be hired on staff. We can all attest to the great
improvements she has made in the library. Clients often tell us how
helpful her work is. If we hired her as of the beginning of the next pay
period, it would probably simplify our payroll taxes for 1993 - we
wouldn't have to keep track of her both as an independent contractor and
(if we hired her on staff at a later date) as an employee.
HAF adopt new procedures for reviewing and carrying new
products (other than drugs). Currently there are two people (Richard W.
and Lewin) working together on this. If they disagree, then new products
tend to be nixed. I suggest that we have three people on a committee that
meets regularly and decides by vote. The third person could be Matthew or
a knowledgeable volunteer, like Buz or William.
product discounts be extended to ex-board members & long time
volunteers who meet certain criteria. Perhaps service of more than one
year, in both cases, could be the criteria. Right now this would mostly
affect only one person, who has specifically asked to get a discount Tony
Bardo, ex-board member of long standing.",0.9877455830574036,"12/12/92

Reassurances are few and far
between in this book. After
stating that the AIDS virus is
very fragile and dies quickly out-
side the body, Kaplan never-
theless warns darkly that semen
left unwashed on the hands after
a sexual encounter could enter
the body: ""If you bite your nails
or eat something with your
fingers a few hours later, some
virus might have survived and
you could become infected.""
At this point, the reader may
correctly conclude that the only
thing worse than a deadly com-
municable virus is an author
such as Dr. Kaplan who manages
to get such drivel published.
Nowhere are the needs of les-
bian, bisexual and Third World
women, or partners of IV drug
users addressed in this book
other than in a few scant lines.
And Kaplan undermines her
credibility with an incessant use
of exclamation points and italics
that rivals Cosmopolitan.
Women who get through this
alarmist, heterosexist tome are
likely to feel frightened,
frustrated and angry, particular-
ly with men who, Kaplan im-
plies, cannot be trusted to be
truthful or communicative when
it comes to negotiating AIDS
prevention tactics in a relation-
ship. For the real truth about
women and AIDS, Patton's and
Kelly's Making It and Richard-
son's Women and AIDS are
your best bets.

dilute solution of lysol.
reassurances are few and far
between in this book. after
stating that the aids virus is
very fragile and dies quickly out-
side the body, kaplan never-
theless warns darkly that semen
left unwashed on the hands after
a sexual encounter could enter
the body: ""if you bite your nails
or eat something with your
fingers a few hours later, some
virus might have survived and
you could become infected.""
at this point, the reader may
correctly conclude that the only
thing worse than a deadly com-
municable virus is an author
such as dr. kaplan who manages
to get such drivel published.
nowhere are the needs of les-
bian, bisexual and third world
women, or partners of iv drug
users addressed in this book
other than in a few scant lines.
and kaplan undermines her
credibility with an incessant use
of exclamation points and italics
that rivals cosmopolitan.
women who get through this
alarmist, heterosexist tome are
likely to feel frightened,
frustrated and angry, particular-
ly with men who, kaplan im-
plies, cannot be trusted to be
truthful or communicative when
it comes to negotiating aids

To: All Board and Staff
Re: Vacation Schedule for Summer
Following are the approximate times of vacations that I would like to take
in the next few months. Please note that the Board and Staff have been
notified of these plans previously. I was notified of the acceptance of the
poster for AIDS VIII on May 6.
5/19/92

arrangements ASAP.

the same times, so that we can attempt to make arrangements to
accommodate everyone.

AIDS Medicine & Miracles Conference in Boulder, CO.
July 2 & 3, Thursday & Friday: for Diamonds in the Desert, the annual

Clubs.)
-
Probable Two or three weeks off sometime between July 7 and
August 8. This is focused around July 21 to 26, Tuesday through
Saturday, for the VIII International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. David
Baker and I have been accepted for a poster presentation. We hope to take
an extra week or two to tour Europe. I realize all this means I may be
gone for 4 weeks, most or all of which would be in July. With our three
new employees, and our bookkeeper about to take over accounts receivable
and payable, I think this is feasible. I would of course make arrangements
for all necessary work to get done on time.
In addition I will take off one day between June 19 and 27 for the Gay

Dear Mr. Coppock:
Your physician has prescribed Pentamidine by inhalation for you.
This medication has been well proven as a treatment for pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia when used intravenously. It has been widely used as an aerosol by
inhalation in an attempt to prevent further episodes of pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia; however, no one has yet proven that it is effective when used in
this way. There are several research projects currently underway attempting
to demonstrate its effectiveness. Until these experiments are completed and
the full risks and effectiveness of the aerosolized pentamidine are known, it
is still considered an experimental drug. Experimental treatments are not
covered by your Prudential Plus insurance policy, nor by most other insurance
policies.
The Food & Drug Administration has given aerosolized pentamidine the status as
an Investigational New Drug (IND). Under this provision, an experimental drug
can be sold by the manufacturer outside of the confines of a strict research
protocol. While this policy by the FDA does make aerosolized pentamidine more
widely available, it does not change its status as an investigational drug.
Sincerely,

From: Richard Copeland
2/8/92
I feel that it is very important to deal with the current situation
concerns,
regarding ddC with the utmost integrity. There are a number of areas of
concern, some of which the Board has already moved to address. However,
there are some concerns that I believe are not being addressed properly,
including; client medical
anticipating
FDA moves to curtail
buyer's clubs' activities, informing our clientelle about the situation. I
am writing to you to suggest specific actions to deal with each of these
areas. Some of these suggestions have indeed been discussed and agreed
to assure that they get acted upon at the Board
to, but I include them
meeting.
Client Medical Concerns
The FDA has suggested that we make the results of their tests available
to our clients. There seems to be agreement that we should make the
results available. We need to discuss how to do that.
Some people will undoubtedly be concerned about the effects that the
dosage variations, both low and high, may have had on their health. I
suggest that we commission another
agency to assemble
a panel of
doctors to give an independent opinion of possible health effects.
A few people have already expressed interest in having our ddC, as
preferable to not having any. One place for them to get ddC is through
expanded access, but there are limitations
to access through that channel
which perhaps someone else is more familiar with than I. I would like to
consider giving away bottles of ours, with a statment of the test results,
so that clients can make up their own minds about using it.
I think that we should assess the viability of collecting samples from
past batches and having them independently tested, so that clients can
determine the likelihood and time period for which they may have been
using undetermined potencies of ddC. If it turns out that past batches
have been OK, then the medical impact of the problem is somewhat
lessened, our credibility is increased and the possibility of obtaining
from the same source in the future, which may be the most efficient
to get it, is increased.

We should talk to our lawyer. He is, however, on the Project
of Directors, 50 we cannot consider him impartial.
FDA Moves
Given the chance that the FDA may
use this as an opportunity to make
moves on the buyer's clubs, I suggest that we rally support from various
sectors now, so that we can be ready in case the FDA takes drastic
actions. Act Up/Golden Gate has been contacted, through Tomas. We
should also consider contacting ACT UP/SF, Carole Migden, Roberta
Achtenberg, Harry Britt, Nancy Pelosi, Milton Marks, the gay Democratic
clubs, as well as coordinating strategies with other AIDS organizations,
such as AIDS Treatment News, etc.

Dr. Arthur Small, M.D.
Medical Director
The Prudential Insurance Company of America
1400 Fashion Island Boulevard, Suite 210
San Mateo, California 94404
Dear Dr. Small:
I have just received your letter of February 28, 1989, regarding your
company's decision to drop payment benefits for aerosolized pentamidine
treatments.
That the FDA has blundered again in its decision to classify Pentamidine
administered via mist as an Investigational New Drug is certainly no
surprise, considering the agency's historic inability to do anything in
a pragmatic, humane or logical way. But it is downright shameful that
this semantic shift in the way the FDA views the drug has been so quickly
capitalized upon by U.S. insurance carriers to deny benefits, and
maximize their profits at the expense of people's lives and futures.
If this weren't so, how can you explain that your company paid for this
treatment for FOURTEEN MONTHS before suddenly changing its mind?
I am just one man, and I don't earn enough money to pay for these
treatments without the help of insurance. You're a doctor, you tell
me: I had 13 T-Helper cells in my last blood draw a week ago, and
that count has been below 50 for more than six months now. Without
this treatment, just how long do you think it will be before I
develop Pneumocystis? Six months, maybe a year? And your company will
save how much--$3,000--by denying these benefits?
How much will the standard 21 hospital days with the drug administered
IV cost you? $12,000? $14,000? $16,000? You tell me, since you have
the statistics and the hospital bills of other patients. It certainly
doesn't make any fiscal sense in the short term, does it? But then,
I think there's a larger agenda going on here. If, by not preventing
the onset of Pneumocystis with these treatments, I actually get the
disease, I will probably lose 10 to 20% of my total body weight, all
my strength, and my system will less able to fight off future infections.
Plus there's the good chance that my system will be desensitized to
Pentamidine as a result of IV infusion on that scale. All of this
can only set me up to get sick again, sooner, and more frequently,
thereby decreasing my actual lifespan. And the shorter my lifespan,
the fewer months or years that Prudential will have to pay for the
various other exotic and costly infections this syndrome produces.
Thus, in the long term, the decision to not provide benefits for
this treatment in effect shortens my life and saves you money.
While I am appalled by this decision, I am not particularly surprised,
in light of my past difficulties in dealing with your company. I am,
however, extremely saddened to see that you, a physician who has
presumably taken the Hippocratic Oath to preserve life, should
collude with actuaries and conspire with bureaucrats in endorsing
such a decision, particularly in the face of recent and mounting
evidence that Aerosolized Pentamidine does, indeed, seem to minimize
the recurrence of PCP, and would thus by logical extension, tend
to prevent or minimize its onset in severely immunocompromised
patients. Shame on you. I just wish that you were the one that had
to write my mother back in Mississippi and explain why benefits to
pay for a treatment that would likely prolong my life are being
denied.

Dear Gentlepersons:
We have not yet met. My name is Tomas Fabregas and I have AIDS.
Almost two years ago I was diagnosed with AIDS during my second semester at
Berkeley's Graduate School of Business. The diagnosis was quite a surprise.
It certainly helped redirect my energies away from the pursuit of an
investment banking career and into ending the AIDS epidemic.
During the last two years, I have learned a lot about AIDS.
This knowledge, acquired through reading and participation in scientific
conferences on AIDS, has enabled me to actively contribute to the solution of
the AIDS epidemic. in May I will be finishing my MBA, and I am planning to
apply the skills learned in school to the search for an answer. But I need
your help, we need your help.
ACT UP/GOLDEN GATE is a non-partisan group committed to ending the AIDS
epidemic. Since the creation of ACT UPs all over the world, much progress has
been made in speeding up research and drug approval, and in making
experimental drugs available to those who need them.
ble to
The AIDS epidemic is unlike other diseases in that its brunt has been
borne by young people. Instead of giving up in despair, many people with AIDS
(PWAS) have become involved in being a part of the solution of this epidemic.
People with AIDS and AIDS activists are breaking historic new ground. Never
before have those affected by a devastating life-threatening disease organized
to bring about change the way science is conducted. Thanks to this active
participation in the halls of science, pressure has built for faster access to
experimental treatments for people who are failing standard therapies. Today,
more than 11,000 people with AIDS who have failed AZT are receiving DDI even
though the drug has not yet been approved by FDA bureaucrats. DDI is not a
cure for AIDS, but it is keeping people alive while waiting for more
effective, less toxic drugs.
Since 1989, people with AIDS and AIDS activists have been key
participants in national and international AIDS conferences. ACT UP/GOLDEN
GATE is looking for sponsors willing to defray the cost of sending 10 people
with AIDS and AIDS activists to the three AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG)",0.9879416823387146,"tomas fabregas

When/Where: These events will take place every Wednesday from
7:30pm-9:00pm in the HAF library. In order to make this possible, Richard
W. is willing to keep the office open until 9:00 on Wednesdays. This would
also give the public one weekday evening when they can purchase our
products, which is something many members have suggested.
Facilitation: The group will be facilitated by volunteers, who will
participate in a group facilitation training with Steven.
Attendance: This will be an open, drop-in group, open to anyone who is
interested in alternative therapies.
Format/Content: The format and content of the discussions will be
primarily up to the people participating in the group. Our idea at this
point is to have the discussions be informal yet structured, so that the
facilitator comes prepared with information (and possibly hand-outs)
about the evening's topic and a plan of how to lead the discussion.
However, the emphasis is on discussion among people in the group and the
sharing of info. and experiences.

presentation, while making sure that even here, people in the group are
encouraged to participate. Also, once a month the group will begin at 7:00

sharing of info. and experiences.
once a month, the facilitator will bring in an outside speaker to make a

encouraged to participate. also, once a month the group will begin at 7:00

library for new people.

RATIONALE
4-10-92
One of the goals at HAF is to create a comfortable and supportive
atmosphere for people to share information and personal experiences
about alternative therapies. We would like to see this happen more than it
currently does. It seems as if people either buy products and leave, or do
their own reading in the library. Most discussion goes on between clients
and staff, not among clients.
One way we thought we could facilitate more discussion among people
would be to bring in speakers and hold informational presentations which
we would publicize in the community, i.e. an educational speakers series.
This would also serve to bring new people into our office and increase the
number of people who use our services. The project would be a considered
a volunteer project--volunteers would find speakers, organize the
presentation, and publicize the events, with guidance and assistance from
Steven.
However, a couple of concerns have come up around this approach. One is
that a continual speakers series is a great deal of work, and this is a
volunteer project. Another concern is that it seems too much like ""calling
in the 'experts"""" to lecture to people, as opposed to the clients talking and
sharing among themselves.
PROPOSAL
A new volunteer has suggested something that would serve our purposes
better than a traditional educational series: a discussion group that would
be something of a support group for people utilizing alternative therapies.
This would not be an emotional support group, but rather an informational
support group which would undoubtably also be a source of emotional
support, as many people have to deal with a serious lack of support (or
outright discouragement and hostility) from their doctors in seeking
alternative treatments.
Out of discussion in the office, the following proposal has taken shape:",0.9599767327308656,"proposal: haf alternative therapies rap group
